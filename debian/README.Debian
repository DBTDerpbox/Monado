monado for Debian
-----------------

The active OpenXR runtime is controlled by
/etc/xdg/openxr/1/active_runtime.json. This file is managed by the
update-alternatives system, under the name openxr1-active-runtime.

Note that at this time, you can have only a single runtime active, across all
architectures. (This is an upstream bug in the OpenXR loader spec, tracked here:
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source/issues/148>) This package is
built so that the runtime will be found in the default path, so you can have
this runtime installed on multiple architectures and have them all work
(assuming dependencies permit). However, you'd switch between Monado and some
other runtime for all architectures at once.
