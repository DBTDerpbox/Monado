Description: Monado XR hardware and composition service
 Monado is an open-source package for interacting with virtual and
 augmented reality (collectively known as XR) hardware and software.
 .
 This package provides the service that provides the VR compositor and
 hardware drivers to Monado clients like libopenxr1-monado.

Description: Monado implementation of the OpenXR API
 Monado is an open-source package for interacting with virtual and
 augmented reality (collectively known as XR) hardware and software.
 .
 This package provides a runtime that aims to be a complete and conforming
 implementation of the OpenXR API from Khronos. When used with the
 "simulated" device driver, this package is conformant with OpenXR 1.0.
 When used with any other driver, this package is based on a published
 Khronos Specification and is expected to pass the Khronos Conformance
 Process. Current conformance status can be found at
 www.khronos.org/conformance.
