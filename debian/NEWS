monado (0.3.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

    This build of Monado on Linux supports running much of the runtime
    in "service mode", with a systemd user service and socket activation
    auto-starting it.

    To enable this without logging out and back in, run:

    systemctl --user enable monado
    systemctl --user start monado.socket

    If you do not do that, you will need to start monado-service manually
    before running an OpenXR-based application.

    To stop Monado, run:

    systemctl --user stop monado.service

    and run the following to allow manually running a monado-service instance:

    systemctl --user stop monado.socket
